    "# Standard Variational Autoencoders for Collaborative Filtering on MovieLens dataset. \n",
    "This notebook accompanies the paper \"*A Hybrid Variational Autoencoder for Collaborative Filtering*\" by Kilol Gupta, Mukund Y. Raghuprasad, Pankhuri Kumar [[Gupta et al.,2018]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1808.01006.pdf). We will study a part of this paper, more specific, the derivation of the \"*Standard Variational Autoencoder*\" [[Gupta et al.,2018, chapter 5.1]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1808.01006.pdf) . \n",

    "The \"*Standard Variational Autoencoder*\" is enhanced using $\\mathbf \\beta$-VAE [[Higgins et al, 2016]](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=Sy2fzU9gl), [[Burgess et al, 2018]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.03599.pdf). Also, for tuning the parameter $\\mathbf \\beta$ an annealing methodology is used based on [[Bowman et al, 2015]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.06349.pdf) and [[Liang, Dawen, et al,2018]](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3178876.3186150?casa_token=Heh8W001edYAAAAA:P_y4buj0zb2ml8GpDXONkrc3EYEBOxgjZNAJOuqes60aeJ4C1Vg1Wq5Eh6mkCXhxNKp38pO_eUw).\n",

    "In this notebook, we will show a complete self-contained example of training a \"*Standard Variational Autoencoder*\" with a simple ELBO function/loss (described in the original paper) and the prosposed extention of it. The public Movielens-1M dataset is used for training and evaluating our model. For this notebook it is assumed that the reader has basic knowledge about VAE [[Kingma et al, 2013]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1312.6114.pdf). \n",

    "__Standard-VAE Model__: Autoencoder based recommendation is an unsupervised model attempting to reconstruct its input data in the output layer. The middle layer (bottleneck layer) is used as a salient feature representation of the input data. In this notebook, we study the standard variational autoencoder and derive the variational lower bound loss function of the standard variational autoencoder. The output of the SVAE is a probability distribution over the K items. This differs from the normal VAE that has the final output as the reconstructed input. So, the SVAE takes the user ratings in the form of a click matrix, $\\mathbf{x}_u$, as inputs and then are encoded to learn the mean, $\\mathbf{m}_u$, and the standard deviation, $\\mathbf{\\sigma}_u$, of the K-dimensional latent representation through the encoder function, $\\mathbf{g}_\\phi(\\mathbf{x}_u)$ = $\\mathbf{m}_u$, $\\mathbf{\\sigma}_u$. In other words, the latent vector for each user,  $\\mathbf{z}_u$, is sampled from the Gaussian distribution, where $\\mathbf{z}_u$ ∼ N($\\mathbf{m}_u$, $\\mathbf{\\sigma}_u$). Then, the decoder function, $\\mathbf{f}_\\theta$($\\mathbf{z}_u$) = $\\mathbf{\\pi}_u$, is used to decode the latent vector from K-dimensional space to a probability distribution $\\mathbf{\\pi}_u$ in the original N-dimensional space. As a result, we get the probabilities of each of the N movies being viewed by each user."
